# Adding a Screenshot to Your README

To enhance your GitHub repository's visibility and appeal, consider adding a screenshot of your Market Pattern Explorer application to the README file.

## Steps to Add a Screenshot

1. **Take a screenshot of your application** in action, showing key features such as:
   - The main interface with stock data loaded
   - Vector database similarity search results
   - Visualizations of pattern clustering

2. **Save the screenshot** in this `assets` directory with a descriptive name like `market_pattern_explorer_preview.png`

3. **Add the screenshot to your README.md** by inserting this Markdown code:

```markdown
![Market Pattern Explorer Preview](assets/market_pattern_explorer_preview.png)
```

## Best Practices

- Use a high-quality screenshot with clear text
- Capture a meaningful view that showcases the app's capabilities
- Consider adding multiple screenshots to highlight different features
- Optimize image size for web viewing (aim for under 1MB)

## Example Placement

The screenshot should ideally be placed near the top of your README, just after the project introduction and before the installation instructions, to immediately show users what they'll get when they install your application.
